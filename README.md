# My Cat Website
A demo with extension problems using [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)


## Live Demo Goals
A high-level overview of what the live demo is going to cover:

1. ~~fetch a random cat pic from the API and display it~~
2. ~~re-fetch the cat pic without refreshing the browser~~
3. ~~get a random cat pic by breed~~
4. ~~add a "favorite cats" list~~
5. ~~add a gallery of favorite cats~~
6. organize our random cat pic and gallery into separate tabs/views

# Extension Problems
These can be done in whatever order you want! They are more or less sorted by difficulty, but that's subjective -- so if you get stuck, feel free to move on to another one.
